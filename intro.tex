Strength and stability are two core issues in terms of understanding
structures. Strength represents the capacity of individual elements to
withstand applied forces, whereas stability represents the capability of a
system to transfer various forces to the ground.

It is imporant to understand that it is possible to design a system that offers
the required strength on all comprised elements without offering the required
stability. Stability is more a matter of interplay between constituing system
elements.
